# Vest Dapp

A small dapp where organizations are created with stakeholders (who can be whitelisted to claim tokens after a period of time).

## Description

This Dapp allows Organizations to come onboard and add their organizations. Each organization can then proceed to add stakeholders to the organization. A stakeholder can be whitelisted or not to claim tokens after a certain period of time has elapsed. An ERC 20 token is created immediately for each organization each time they register.


### Executing program

Functions like adding or organization, adding stake holders for organization, claiming tokens, getting an organization details by id, etc are available in the Dapp.
